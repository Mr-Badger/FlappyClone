# WEPO project 4
Css hardware accelerated Flappy Birds clone.

## Prerequisite, must have the following programs installed
* NodeJS
* Chrome
* Python

## Installation and running
* Run start-init.bat

## Features
* The game is responsive and playable on mobile and tablets. Has been tested on iPad Air, Samsung Galaxy S3 and S5, iPhone.
* Includes a trip mode with changing psychedelic colors, moving pipes and varying music speed. Trip mode colors render correctly in Chrome for desktop but not in other browser or devices.
* High score is stored locally.
* All the graphics are drawn with CSS. 
* Clouds and buildings in the background are generated randomly on the fly and move in parallax to the foreground.

## Known bugs
* Ongoing lag issue on some devices. We've investigated the issue using the timeline in Chrome but the lag spikes that arise fall under "other" so we've not been able to figure out the problem. 
* Small desync issue when a player gets further into the game.
